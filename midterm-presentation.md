Hello everyone we are 9 Noobs. Today we are going to present our 2d platformer game.

We will start by introducing mechanisms with our tutorial levels, then followed with a level to put them into practice.

Let us start from beginning to introduce basic operations. To begin with, we move the girl with A and D, jump by space,
and double jump by hitting space twice. Then I reach the goal, the blue bar.

NOW, the second tutorial. I go to the black bar, OH I am trapped. What can I do? Here comes **the key idea of our game:
switch the world. Now, Press J to switch**, and oh, we get out of the black box. Because I mingle the barrier and the
background by switching the world.

Another mechanism in our game is **echo**. Echo helps detect surroundings and explore the world. If you only switch, you
will drop from the bar, so you have to detect first, and then jump and switch, just as shown here for 3 times.

Now that we've covered all the operations, let's apply them. The game can select levels from the level menu. Let me
select level 2 as an example that combines all tricks I just introduced. As you see now, the actual level will be
covered with fog, so you have limited vision. If you die, it prompts you to restart by pressing R.

At the beginning, we repeat the switch, detect, and jump as before. Honestly speaking, this is not easy so you have to
practice several times. Now we encounter some barrier that is too high to jump over. What can you do? Just switch the
world, and mingle the bar with the world.

There are also dangerous spikes in your way, if you touch them, you are done. How can you pass through? Actually, you
can either jump, just like what you do when you meet a barrier, OR, you can switch the world!

Now again its detect-jump-switch time. One more thing We can also switch to intentionally drop for a short while to
reach the lower bars.

We have more mechanisms waiting you to explore. We sincerely hope you love this game. Thank you!
